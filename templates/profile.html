                    We monitor this site for quality purposes, so if we feel an entry has been made that isn't quite right, we will 
                    either correct it or remove it all together. We also ask that members try to keep their entries clean, there are 
                    many slang terms that are deemed inappropriate, again, if they are inappropriate they will be removed. We hope you 
                    enjoy browsing and contributing towards this site.
